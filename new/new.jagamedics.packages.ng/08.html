<h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>Checking on the health of those you trust to look after your household is a very important issue. Our Domestic Staff Screening tests provide you with necessary information you require to ensure that your domestic help has a clean bill of health before they become part of the household.</p>>
   Domestic Staff Health Screening is a set of tests that checks for communicable diseases in the staff that work in homes. Domestic workers are individuals hired to work within private homes to clean, cook, provide care to children, the elderly, or disabled individuals.
   They include stewards &amp; cooks, house helps &amp; nannies as well as others whose jobs involve close contact with members of the family.</p>
